✨🎮 Week 7 – Game Development Progress Report 🎮✨

🌍 Immersive Terrain World We designed and implemented a fully navigable Terrain-based environment using Unity’s Terrain GameObject, forming the foundation of our playable world.

🎥 Player & Camera System Our main character is equipped with a smooth, player-following rotated camera, fully synchronized with user input to create an intuitive and immersive experience:

⌨️ W / A / S / D – Basic movement controls
🧎 C – Crouching mechanism
⚡ Left Shift – Sprinting / speed boost
🤖 Enemy AI Behavior System Enemies are driven by a dynamic state-based AI, capable of transitioning seamlessly between:

🔁 Patrol
🔄 Rotation / scanning
🏃 Chase
🔫 Shooting
Weapons are implemented using a Tommy Gun asset from the Unity Asset Store. The shooting system relies on a collision-tracking bullet script, detecting and responding to hit events precisely at the projectile’s point of contact.

🕒 Design Constraints Due to time limitations imposed by the weekly submission format, a reset functionality was not implemented in this version.

🏠 Environment Design with ProBuilder To enhance realism and world detail, we used Unity ProBuilder to construct a small house structure, which was then carefully populated with various pieces of furniture and decorative elements.

✨ Overall, this week focused on combining player mechanics, AI behavior, and environmental design into a cohesive and engaging gameplay experience. 🚀
